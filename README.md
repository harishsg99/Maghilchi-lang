# Maghilchi
 Maghilchi is a custom interpreted language with a free, natural language-like syntax with tamil keywords

# Why Maghilchi?
In Tamil Nadu(India), There are millions of students who studies in tamil medium schools or schools who use tamil as medium of teaching subjects. Many wants to learn coding since most of the proggraming language is English they see that as barrier. So I decided to make proggraming language that use tamil in syntax instead of English which will eventually breaks that language barrier.

# Goals for Maghilchi:
1. Simple and natural language based Programming language
2. Hassle Free Installation and configuration so that anyone can install easily and use!
3. Need to add various functionality such as GUI Creation, networking support etc which will encourage kids to create games etc

## How to Access Source Code of Maghilchi.

Until first version of stable release source code of Maghilchi will be closed source as I need to do lots of code cleanup as code is clumsy as of now.

## Usage/Examples

Copmiler Usage:

```
