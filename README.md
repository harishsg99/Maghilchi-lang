# Maghilchi
 Maghilchi is a interpreted language with a natural language-like syntax with tamil words.

# Why Maghilchi?
In Tamil Nadu(India), There are millions of students who studies in tamil medium schools or schools who use tamil as medium of teaching subjects. Many of them wants to learn coding since most of the proggraming language is in English they see that as barrier. So I decided to make proggraming language that use tamil in syntax instead of English which will eventually breaks that language barrier. This will help many students from tamil mediums to become a good programmer in the future, Even some of them might use proggraming skills to create product to solve real life problems.

# Goals for Maghilchi:
1. Simple and natural language based Programming language
2. Hassle Free Installation and configuration so that anyone can install easily and use!
3. Need to add various functionality such as GUI Creation, networking support etc which will encourage kids to create games etc
4. Memory Safe programming language for security of applications.
